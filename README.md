# Terraform Tutorials
This repository contains Terraform modules that I've implemented by reading official Terraform tutorials.
A large portion of the effort I've put into this repository was actually focused on writing GitHub Actions workflows. 
The goal of this small project was indeed dual: I both wanted to get started with Terraform, and I also wanted to simulate a real CI/CD workflow for Infrastructure as Code.
